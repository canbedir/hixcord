# Hixcord

Welcome to **Hixcord**! This chat application is inspired by the popular communication platform, Discord. Hixcord aims to provide a seamless and interactive messaging experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging:** Chat with friends and communities in real-time. (Yes, you can finally stop using carrier pigeons.)
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy to navigate, inspired by Discord's design. (No need for a PhD in Rocket Science to use this!)
- **Custom Emojis:** Add fun and expressive emojis to your conversations. (Because words are hard.)
- **Voice Channels:** Join voice channels for real-time voice communication. (Talk to humans without actually being in the same room. Magic!)
- **File Sharing:** Share files, images, and links with your contacts. (Even that embarrassing meme you love.)
- **Moderation Tools:** Manage your server with moderation features. (Become the benevolent dictator you were always meant to be.)
